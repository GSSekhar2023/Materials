Given an unsorted array, find the max length of subsequence in which the numbers are in incremental order.
For example: If the input array is {7, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 6}, a subsequence with the most numbers in incremental order is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9} and the expected output is 6.


Given a string, that contains special character together with alphabets (‘a’ to ‘z’ and ‘A’ to ‘Z’), reverse the string in a way that special characters are not affected.
Examples:
Input: str = "a,b$c"
Output: str = "c,b$a"
OR
Input: str = "Ab,c,de!$"
Output: str = "ed,c,bA!$"


static void Main()
{
 String str="a,b$c";
char[] c=new char(str);
if(c.
