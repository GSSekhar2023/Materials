   Question :- 

   SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL BETWEEN 10000 AND 5000 

   A   ERROR
   B   RETURNS ROWS 
   C  RETURNS NO ROWS
   D  NONE 

   ANS :-  C

   WHERE SAL BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000    (SAL>=5000 AND SAL<=10000)

   WHERE SAL BETWEEN 10000 AND 5000    (SAL>=10000 AND SAL<=5000)

   NOTE :- use BETWEEN operator with lower and upper
                 don't use with upper and lower


 => employees working as clerk,manager and earning between 5000 and 10000
      and joined in 2020 and not working for dept 10,20 ?

      SELECT *
      FROM EMP
      WHERE JOB  IN ('CLERK','MANAGER')
                    AND
                    SAL BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000
                    AND
                    HIREDATE BETWEEN  '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
                    AND
                    DNO NOT IN (10,20)

=>

  display  samsung,redmi,realme mobile phones price between 10000 and 20000 ?

     SELECT *

                     AND
                    CATEGORY='MOBILE PHONES'
                    AND
                    PRICE BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000

   => 

    CUSTOMERS
    CID    NAME     GENDER     AGE     CITY  

    list of male customers age between 30 and 40 and staying in hyd,blr,mum ?

    SELECT *
    FROM CUSTOMERS
    WHERE GENDER='MALE'
                   AND
                   AGE BETWEEN 30 AND 40
                   AND
                   CITY IN ('HYD','BLR','MUM')

 LIKE operator :- 
 ---------------------

 => use LIIKE operator for pattern comparision

    
       WHERE  COLNAME  LIKE  'PATTERN'
       

 => pattern contains alphabets,digits,special chars and wildcard chars.

   wildcard chars :- 
   -------------------------

      %        => 0 or many chars

      _         => exactly 1 char

 
   => employees name starts with 'S' ?

        SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME  LIKE  'S%' 

  => employees name ends with 'R' ?

      SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME  LIKE  '%R'

  => employees name contains 'A" ?

       SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME  LIKE  '%A%' 

   => where  'A' is the 3rd char in their name ?
 
        SELECT *
        FROM EMP
        WHERE ENAME LIKE  '__ A%' 

  => where 'A' is the 3rd char from last ?

       SELECT *
       FROM EMP
       WHERE  ENAME LIKE  ' %A__'

 Question :- 

  SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB IN ('CLERK','MAN%')

  A  ERROR 
 B  RETURNS CLERK,MANAGER records
 C  RETURNS ONLY CLERK records
 D  NONE


  ANS :- C

  =>  'MAN%'  is not treated as pattern  because operator is not LIKE and it is IN
        
    SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB='CLERK'   OR  JOB  LIKE  'MAN%'  

    ANS :-  B

    => employees joined in oct month ?            YYYY-MM-DD

       SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE LIKE '_____10___'
 
     => employees joined in 2020 year ?

        SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE LIKE '2020%' 

   => employees name starts with 'A','V','S' ?

       SELECT * 
        FROM EMP 
        WHERE  ENAME LIKE  'A%'
                       OR
                       ENAME LIKE 'V%'
                       OR 
                       ENAME LIKE 'S%' 

    SELECT *
    FROM EMP 
    WHERE ENAME  LIKE   '[AVS]%' 

 
    [  ]  =>  use square brackets to specify group of chars in particular position.

   => name starts between 'A' and 'P'  ?

        SELECT *
        FROM EMP
        WHERE  ENAME  LIKE  ' [A-P]%' 

  IS operator :- 
  ------------------

  => use IS operator for NULL comparision

       WHERE  COLNAME IS NULL
       WHERE  COLNAME IS NOT NULL

 => find the employees not earning salary ?

     SELECT *
     FROM EMP
     WHERE SAL  IS  NULL 

 => find the employees earning salary ?

     SELECT *
     FROM EMP
     WHERE SAL IS NOT NULL 

 
 summary :- 

 WHERE  COLNAME  IN  (V1,V2,V3,--)
 WHERE  COLNAME BETWEEN V1 AND V2
 WHERE  COLNAME LIKE 'PATTERN'
 WHERE  COLNAME IS  NULL
