Database :-
--------------

=> a  database is a organized collection of interrelated data , for example a univ db 
     stores data related to students,courses,faculty etc.

 Types of DB :- 
 -----------------

   1  OLTP  DB   (online transaction processing) 
   2  OLAP DB   (online analytical processing)

 => OLTP db is for storing day-to-day transactions and OLAP for data analysis.
 => OLTP is for running business and OLAP is for analyzing business.
 => day-to-day operations on db includes

    C   create
    R   read
    U   update
    D   delete

 DBMS :- 
 ------------

 => DBMS stands for Database Management System  , It is a software used to 
      create and to manage database.

   Evolution of DBMS :- 
   ----------------------------

   1960		 FMS   (File Mgmt System)

   1970		HDBMS (Hierarchical DBMS)
		NDBMS (Network DBMS)
 
   1980		RDBMS (Relational DBMS)

   1990		ORDBMS (Object Relational DBMS)

  
 RDBMS :- 
 --------------

 => RDBMS concepts are introduced by E.F.CODD
 => according to E.F.CODD in rdbms data must be organized in tables i.e. rows and columns
 
   CUST
   CID	NAME	ADDR  => column/field/attribute
   1	SACHIN  MUM
   2	RAHUL	DEL
   3	VIJAY	HYD  => row/record/tuple
   
     DB     		 =    collection of tables 
     TABLE		 =    collection of rows & columns
     ROW                   =    collection of field values
     COLUMN            =    collection of values assigned to one field

   => every table must contain primary key to uniquely identify the records.

             ex :-  accno,empid,aadharno,panno,voterid
 
  RDBMS features :-  
  -------------------------

   1   easy to access & manipulate data
   2   less  redundency (duplication of data) 
   3   more security 
   4   guranteess data quality or data consistency
   5   supports data sharing
   6   supports transactions 

 RDBMS softwares :-   (SQL databases)
 ----------------------------
 
 SQL SERVER         from microsoft
 ORACLE                 from oracle corp
 DB2                         from ibm
 MYSQL                   from oracle corp
 POSTGRESQL       from postgresql forum

 ORDBMS :-  
 -----------------

 =>  object relational database management system
 =>  it is the combination of rdbms & oops 

            ORDBMS =   RDBMS + OOPS (reusability)

 =>  RDBMS doesn't support reusability but ORDBMS supports reusability.

  RDBMS :- 
  ---------------

  CUST
  CID    NAME    HNO   STREET   CITY   STATE    PIN

  EMP
  EMPID  ENAME  HNO  STREET  CITY   STATE   PIN

  STUDENT
  SID      SNAME    HNO  STREET   CITY   STATE   PIN

 => in the above example  in all the three tables address is repeated and when 
      addr repeated  we need to repeat 5 fields 

  ORDBMS :- 
  ----------------

 TABLE :-

        ADDR   
        HNO      STREET    CITY    STATE    PIN


 CUST
 CID     NAME      ADDR

EMP
 EMPID  ENAME   ADDR

STUDENT
SID    NAME         ADDR 

=> in above example when address repeated then we need to repeat only one field

 ORDBMS softwares :- 
 ------------------------------

  SQL SERVER 
  ORACLE
  POSTGRESQL

 what is SQL SERVER ?

  => SQL SERVER is basically a rdbms product  from microsoft and also 
        supports ordbms features and used to maintain database.

 DB DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE :- 
 -----------------------------------------------

 1  ANALYSIS
 2  DESIGN
 3  DEVELOPMENT 
 4  TESTING
 5  IMPLEMENTATION
 6  MAINTENANCE

 DB DESIGN :- 
 --------------------

  => designing db means designing tables.
  => db is designed by DB Designer/Architect.
  => db designer designs db by using

       1  ER MODEL (Entity Relationship Model)
       2  NORMALIZATION 
  
DEVELOPMENT :- 
-------------------------

 => Development means creating tables in sql server.
 => DB is developed by Developers & DBAs by using SQL SERVER,ORACLE,MYSQL etc
 
       	    Developer                                              DBA  (Database Admin)

      1            creating tables			 installation of sql server
      2            creating views			 creating database
      3            creating synonyms                                creating logins 
      4            creating sequences                               db backup & restore
      5            creating indexes                                    db export & import
      6            creating procedures                              db upgradation & migration
      7            creating functions                                 performance tuning               
      8            creting triggers 
      9            writing queries


     sql server 2014  ========> sql server 2019     =>   db upgradation

     mysql ==================> sql server       =>    db migration

 
  =>  db is tested by QA teams (Quality Assurance) by using some tools called
        testing tools 

 =>  implementation means moving db from DEV server to PROD server.

=====================================================================

 CLIENT/SERVER  Architecture :- 
 -------------------------------------------

 1    SERVER
 2    CLIENT

 SERVER :- 
 ---------------

 => server is a system where sql server software is installed and running.
 => server manages the following two components 
  
     1   DB
     2   INSTANCE

  => DB is created in hard disk and acts as permanent storage.
 => INSTANCE is created in ram and acts as temporary storage.
 
 CLIENT :- 
 -------------

  => client is also a system where users can 

  1  connects to server
  2  submit the requests 
  3  receives response

client tool :- 
---------------

  SSMS   (SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO)

SQL :- 
---------

 => SQL stands for structured query language.
 => it is a language used to communicate with sql server. 
 => user communicates with sql server by sending commands called queries.
 => a query is a command/instruction/question given to sql server to perform some 
      operation on db.
 => SQL is originally introduced by IBM and initial name of this language was "SEQUEL"
      and later it is renamed to SQL.
 
  => SQL is common to all  rdbms                

       SQL SERVER       ORACLE           MYSQL         DB2
             SQL                     SQL                 SQL              SQL  


     USER-----SSMS-------------SQL------------------SQL SERVER----------DB
                     tool                    lang                       software                     storage

  => based on operations over db  SQL is categorized into following sublanguages.

      DDL  (DATA DEFINITION LANG)
      DML (DATA MANIPULATION LANG)
      DQL (DATA QUERY LANG)  
      TCL  (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANG)
      DCL (DATA CONTROL LANG)

 				SQL
