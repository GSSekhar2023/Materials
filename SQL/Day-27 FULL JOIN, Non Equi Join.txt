 FULL JOIN :- 
 ------------------

  => full join returns all rows from both tables 

       SELECT  E.ENAME,D.DNAME
          FROM  EMP AS E  FULL JOIN DEPT AS D
               ON  E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO

	A	ACCOUNTS
	B	RESEARCH
	C	SALES
	D	ACCOUNTS
 	E	NULL        => unmatched from emp	
                NULL	OPERATIONS => unmatched from dept

 Displaying unmatched records :-
 ---------------------------------------------

 left table :- 
 ---------------

       SELECT  E.ENAME,D.DNAME
          FROM  EMP AS E  LEFT JOIN DEPT AS D
               ON  E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
        WHERE D.DNAME IS NULL 

            E      NULL

 right table :- 
 ----------------
 
       SELECT  E.ENAME,D.DNAME
          FROM  EMP AS E RIGHT JOIN DEPT AS D
              ON  E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
        WHERE  E.ENAME IS NULL

      NULL	   OPERATIONS 

 both tables :- 
 ------------------

       SELECT  E.ENAME,D.DNAME
          FROM  EMP AS E FULL JOIN DEPT AS D
               ON  E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
        WHERE E.ENAME IS NULL 
	      OR
	      D.DNAME IS NULL

       E        	NULL
      NULL   	OPERATIONS

 => display employee details with project details ?

 => display employee details with project details and also display
      employees not assigned to any project ?

 => display employee details with project details and also display
      projects where no employee assigned to it ?

Non Equi Join :- 
---------------------

 =>  Non equi join is performed between the tables not sharing a common field
 
     SELECT columns
     FROM tab1  JOIN  tab2 
         ON  join condition

 => here join condition is not based on "=" operator  and may be based on 
      >   <    between operators.

     Example :-

      EMP				SALGRADE
      EMPNO    ENAME   SAL		GRADE	LOSAL	HISAL
      1	       A             3000		1	700	1000
      2               B             1000		2	1001	2000
      3               C             4000		3	2001	3000
      4               D             2000		4	3001	4000
      5               E             1500		5	4001	9999

    display  ENAME	SAL	GRADE  ?
                 -------------------         ------------
                         EMP                 SALGRADE

      SELECT  E.ENAME,E.SAL,S.GRADE
         FROM  EMP AS E  JOIN SALGRADE AS S
             ON   E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL 

 	A	3000	3
	B	1000	1
	C	4000	4
	D	2000	2
	E	1500	2

 => display grade 4 employee list ?

      SELECT  E.ENAME,E.SAL,S.GRADE
         FROM  EMP AS E  JOIN SALGRADE AS S
             ON   E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL 
       WHERE  S.GRADE = 4 

 => display  ENAME    DNAME     GRADE    ?
                   ----------    -----------     ----------
                     EMP        DEPT        SALGRADE

   SELECT E.ENAME,D.DNAME,S.GRADE
       FROM EMP AS E  INNER JOIN DEPT AS D
           ON  E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
                                     JOIN SALGRADE S
            ON E.SAL  BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL 

 SELF JOIN :- 
 ------------------

  => joining a table to itself is called self join.
  => in self join a record in one table joined with another record of same table.
  => to perform self join the same table must be declared two times with
       different alias.

           FROM  EMP AS  X   JOIN   EMP AS  Y

 Example :- 

   EMP X				  	EMP Y	
   EMPNO	     ENAME	MGR		EMPNO	ENAME	MGR
   1	     A		NULL		1	A	NULL
   2	     B		1		2	B	1
   3	     C		1		3	C	1
   4	     D		2		4	D	2
   5	     E		3		5	E	3
  
 => display  ENAME	    MGRNAME   ?
