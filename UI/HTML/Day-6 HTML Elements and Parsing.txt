                                  HTML Parsing in Browser
1. Developer writes Markup
        <b> Hello </b>
2. It is translated into Bytes
        010101010101
3. Bytes are parsed int Characters

4. Charecters undergo a process called "Tokenization" and creates "Tokens", which are also known as "Tags".
        <b>        Bold Tag

5. Tokens are converted into Elements, which are known as "Nodes".
        <b>        bold element
        <a>        anchor element
        <p>        paragraph element

6. Elements are arranged in a hierarchial order called "DOM" - Document Object Model

7. DOM is processed into Layout using Rendering engine

8. DOM is painted in borwser.

Summary:  HTML presents DOM, which is a hierarchy of Elements.
              HTML is a collection of elements.


                                    HTML Elements

- HTML elements are classified into 5 groups

        1. Normal Elements
        2. Void Elements
        3. RC Data Elements
        4. Raw Text Elements
        5. Foreign Elements

- Normal Elements returns a presentation directly on callback.
  They doesn't require additional attributes.
  They start presenting but will not stop presenting.
  Hence you have to manually stop by using End Token [tag].
  These element requires 2 tokens
        a) Start Token    <b>
        b) End Token    </b>

- Void Elements
   Void refers to no return value.
   Void element will not return any presentation directly on callback.
   It requires attributes that define what to return.
   It returns the specific content and stops implicitly.
   Hence these elements doesn't require End Token.

 Ex:   <img>
        <img src="public/images/kids.jpg">

- RC Data elements are Rich Text Content Elements
  They are used only for rich text and will not allow any another element with in context.
 
Ex:
        <textarea> </textarea>

- Raw Text elements are presented using raw text chars without any token.

Ex:
        &copy;
        &#8377;
        &laquo;
       
- Foreign Elements are presented by using an additional library, they are part of HTML but will not work directly in HTML.

Ex: Canvas, SVG, MathML etc..
