                                                 Styles
                                            ---------
- Styles provide attributes, which are used to make HTML more interactive and responsive.
- You can define styles for HTML elements in 3 ways

        1. Inline Styles
        2. Embedded Styles
        3. External Style Sheets [CSS - Cascade Style Sheets]

Inline Styles:
==========
- Styles are defined for every element individually by using "Style" attribute.

            <h2  style="attribute:value; attribute:value">
            <h2  style="color:red; border:2px solid red">

- Inline styles are faster in rendering.
- They are not good for reusability and extensibility.

Ex:
 <h2 style="color:red; border:2px solid red; background-color: yellow;">HTML</h2>

Embedded Styles
==============
1. In embedded technique the styles are written in <style> container and kept inside page.
2. You can reuse the styles.
3. You can easily extend the styles.

Syntax:
            <style>
                selector
                {
                  attribute:value;
                  attribute:value;
                }
            </style>
